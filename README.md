Rain for Sonar
==============

This project is based on the implementation found here: https://github.com/yungsters/rain-workload-toolkit

The original Rain-Project was extended in multiple ways: 

- Integration with Sonar Times which holds workload traces in a central location
- Added Thrift RPC to control a Rain process
- Integration with the Sonar monitoring solution
- Refactoring of the Scoreboard implementation
