Rain+ workload driver
=====================

Rain+ was designed to generate realistic variable workload on an IaaS cloud testbed environment including dynamic allocation and deallocation of VMs during a benchmark. Rain+ extends the original Rain implementation found [here](https://github.com/yungsters/rain-workload-toolkit). It adds the following functionality: 

* Integration with [Sonar](https://github.com/jacksonicson/sonar) and [Times](https://github.com/jacksonicson/times). Time series of request response times and other systems statistics are stored in Sonar. Times serves as an archive for time series data describing variable workload on a target over time. 
* Thrift RPC interfaces to configure and trigger a Rain+ workload driver instances. This allows to synchronize multiple Rain+ instances. 
* Complete refactoring of the Scoreboard implementation to gather statistics. Percentiles on the operation duration are calculated by the [P-Square](https://github.com/jacksonicson/psquared) algorithm without storing samples. 


## Usage scenario

Rain+ is used to generate realistic workload on one or multiple server-side applications running in VMs as shown in thefollowing figure. Load is generated by simulating multiple users that are running queries on the server-side application. To generate querys Rain+ uses a load driver implementation, that is typically required for each application. It implements the code to generate new queries, e.g. by using a Markov chain, and to execute the query on the server-side application.

A load driver is used by many threads in parallel, each one simulating a single application user. The number of parallel simulated users gets varied over time to resemble realistic workload scenarios. The actual number of useres is specified by time series data stored in [Times](https://github.com/jacksonicson/times). Examples are shown in the following figure.

Rain+ supports dynamic targets, new VMs are allocated while existing ones are deallocated during a benchmark. This allows Rain+ to drive realistic workload against an IaaS cloud infrastructure test bed. As shown by the following figure a schedule describes when a new VM gets allocated and how long it lives.

Rain+ and load driver implementations gather statistics during a benchmark. For example the average request response time is measured. This data gets dumped into the [Sonar](https://github.com/jacksonicson/sonar) monitoring system as JSON objects and time series data for later retrival and analysis.
